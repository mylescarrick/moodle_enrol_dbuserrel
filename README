This plugin allows you to configure automatic relationships between users from an external database.  One day, after MDL-13205, this might be folded into enrol/db.

Users familiar with enrol/db should have no problems configuring this.

Plugin has been tested on 1.9 but I don't see why it wouldn't work on HEAD/2.0 too.

Language file enrol_dbuserrel.php needs to go in lang/en_utf8/ (for example)
